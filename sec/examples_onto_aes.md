# WHY EVOLUTION IS A POOR EXPLANATION.
The problem with evluatuionary explanantion is that it ulitmately distills into conincidence.
Or, more precisely,
in this conicidence there are two components:
firts, it all coincidence,
second, it may be not even true.
Now, this requires an error-theory that explains why evolutuionary explanations are so popular.
My error-thoery is that, becuase the very reason that evolutionary explanantion are ultimately unfoldings of coincidence,
they compensate by constructing elaborate stories of how such conicidence was constructed.
This appeals to our taste for story-telling, which make such stories to be popular and eventually accepted as genuine explanations, when in reality they are merely explanations (longer apparently systematic) of coincidences.

The first example is ontological parsimony.
Or, at least, certain interpratations of ontological parsimony.
I will interpret Ockham's Razor ontological vesion would be something like the followoing:
*"Entities must not to be multiplied without necessity."*
It is not hard to document the use of such a principle in the history of scinece.
For example, in the Chemical Revolution,
Lavoisier argued that all of known chemistry can be explained withoth resorting to flogiston.
And that this entails the flogiston does not exist, since it is
*" a principle of logic not to multiply entities unnecessarily"*
[[ZOTERO reference in stanford encyclopedia : (Lavoisier 1862, pp. 623–4).]]
This is well known instance of the ontological Ockham's Razonr used against the existence of flogiston.

Another well documented example is Dirac's postulation of the neutrino to explain anomalous steam chamber observations.
In explaining the anomalies Dirac postulated an until then unobserved particule, which we know as the neutrino.
However, the anomalies could be explicated postulating multiple particles with corresponding adequate properties.
The fact that a single particle was postulated and that
the multiple-particles hypothesis was not even considered is taken as evidence that there is a principle of ontological parsimony at work here.
And Dirac's attitude is not an isolated event, rather it is an instance of the default response in particle physics:
the postulation of novel entities seem to resort to the simplest ontologies almost uncounsciously.

This shows that the principle of ontological parsimony is deeply ingrained even in the default attitudes of scinetists, and that the case of the neutrino is just an example that illustrates this tendency.

Now, the issue of interest here is the rational justification of scientists preference for simpler ontologies, as examplified above.
And as it turns out, it is not easy to answer the question of why postulating fewer entities should be better?
In the case in which simplicity offers obvious pragmatic advantages, of course, such advantages constitues its justification.
Thus, one possibility to justify ontological parsimony would be that there are methodological advantages in using ontolofically parsinous theories in a way similar to the way simplicity offers pragmatic advantages in other fields.
That is, if there are pragmatic advantages of simplicity in diverse areas of practice and development, maybe analogous advantages may be found in science's methods and evaluation practices.

I believe that Heather Douglas suggest something along this lines to justify simplicity in science.
Douglas suggests that simpler theories are better becuase they are easier to testt
[[ZOTERO DOUGLAS SIMPLICITY]].
This suggestion seems to have merit for the case of ontological parsimony.
Since it is plausible that a parsimounious ontoloy, an ontoly with fewer entities, may be easier to test than a more numeroously ontology.
However, the historical case of Lavoisier is inconsistent with Douglas's suggestion.


#### older version of douglas easier to test approach.
Now the most problematic aspect of priciples of ontological parsimony is to find a rational justification.
After all, it is not easy to answer the question why postulating fewer entities should be better?
In this respect, one reasonable strategy that has been attempted is to draw an analogy bweteen the ontological and the pragmatic cases.
I believe that such is the stragegy of Dowglas when she suggests that the reason why simpler theories are better is because they are easier to test.
This idea certainly seems to fit the case of ontological parsimony, at least at first sight.
Since it is not hard to see that simpler ontolologied, that is, the postulation of fewer entities, might entail easier methods to test that more numerous ontologies.
#### ends older version of douglas easier to test approach.

However, the Lavousier example discussed above contradicts Douglas's idea.
Since the opponents of Lavousier argued for flogisto on the grounds that the chemistry of lavousier way too complicated and their experiments more costly, diffucult and complicated.
Thus the simpler ontology of Lavousier was accompanied by more complicated and difficults "chemistry" and methods of testing.
This historical case is a counter example to Douglas suggestion.
Moreover, in the general case, postulating smaller number of entities does not warrant that the testing for such entities is easier.
For example, in response to observed anomalies, scientists may postulate a particle that cannot be detected with the currently available methods.
In such cases one can have an simpler ontology, but one more difficult to test.

Moreover, the deeper problem of justifying simplicity principles concerns the fact that the most interesting cases of simplocity princeples are the cases where such priciples are interpreted as epistemological, and not merely methodological, principles.
The epistemic principle is much harder to justify as it entails an account of how ontological parsimony is cunducive to truth, or to other significant epistemic ends.

____
note:
Now, even if there were methodological advantages, principles such as ontologicla parsimony are most often interpreted as having epistemological import.
Under this interpretation, the question is what is the rational justification to believe that simpler ontologies are conducive to truth, 

or, in a wider, more pluralistic question, conducive to the diverse epistemologist's prefered epistemic ends:
truth, empirical adecuacy, understanding and so on.
In this respect,

the methodological approach is no ofter resorted to.
Instead, stronger kinds of justification are looked for.
According to
[[BBBBBB  stanfor encyclopedia]]
there are no satisfactory answers to the question of justifying ontological parsimony as an epistemic principle.

Two common to address the problem are,
first,
to suggest that the ontological parsimony
priciple is acceptable due to the fact that its a principle used in scinece.
And, second, to suggest that the justification, is not internal to science, as in the first strategy, but external to science and falls in domains such as metaphysics or logic.
For example, Lavousier called the principle of ontological a principle of logic.
This strategies have a problem, I believe, that make them untenable in priciple:
they are viciously circular.

# EXAMPLE SUBJECTIVE JUSTIFICATION.
The second kind of cases are those that have a sujbective justification.
That is, they seem to be justified on ground such as idisincracies, personal taste or aestheric merit.
The Copernican Revolution in astronomy is a well known historical example in which the symplicty of the Heliocentric System, compared to the complexity of the established Ptolemaic system, played a central role in the preference for the former.
Copernicus argued that the Heliocentric System was preferable due to its superior harmony and simplicity.
Moreover, Thomas Kuhn famously argued that such preference had indeed no rational justification.
Since, the preference was justified based on subjective judgements, such as aesthetic preferences for simplicity and harmony.
The Copernican arguments lack evidential grounds and only
*"appeal[ed], if at all … [to an] aesthetic sense, and that alone"*
[[
ZOTERO REFERENCE IN 
Harmony and simplicity: aesthetic virtues and the rise of testability

(Kuhn, 1957, p. 181).1]]
]]

More recent examples abound.
Mathematics, due to the fact that mathematical theries cannot have empirical grouds, rely on simplicity judgements in a everpresent manner.
The importance of simplicity in mathematics permeates to the disciplines that rely on it.
Moreover, simplicity is the most used property in making subjective judgements of taste in mathematics.
In making judgements of the aesthetic merit of a mathematical theorem or proof, the most cited property associate to such merit is its simplicity.

The incresing relevance of mathematics in physics have made the simplicty of mathematical descriptions one of the arguments for preferring physical thoeries; and many times with the associated subjective justification.
For example, Dirac interpreted the beauty in the simplicity and symmety of early quantum theory's mathematical arguments as indicators of the theory's truth.

The same attitude is seen in Richard Feynman, who argued that the truth of a theory may be recognized by its beauty and simplicity.
And some authors have argued that the aesthetic bias for pursuing simple and beautiful mathematical descriptions is one of the motivations for theoretical physics thoeries such as string theory or the current search for dark matter and dark energy.
They all seem to be motivated, at least in part, by the aesthetic allure of mathematical simplicity.
Now, the use of simplicity in thoeretical physics makes sense, I believe, for the same reasons as in mathematics:
if the theory cannot have empirical input, then the obvious way to evaluate it is by using non-empirical properties; such as the aesthetic merit associted to simplicity.

Now, 
as in the case of ontological parsimony, the crucial question is whether there is rational justification with epistemic import.
The first difference one notes is that citing subjective reasons for preferring simper mathematical descriptions, such as the beauty of simplicity, is a justification in itsel.
However, it is a *subjective* justification.
This can be seen in the subjective examples presented above which differ from the 
ontological parsimony examples in terms of explicit justification.
In the case of onlotogical parsimony examples scientists seem to follow a principle, and it is only until the principle is examined for justification that it is discovered that there is none.
In the subjectively based examples, by contrast, the justification, taste, aesthetic preference, beauty, is explicitly formulated by Dirac, Feynman and other physicists.
It would seem that personal taste, aesthetic reasons, may serve as acceptable justifications.
There are authors, however, that recognize that
the real problem in justifyin simplicity is that, as mentioned, must be a rational justification with an epistemic import.
And that
subjectively based reasons cannot play such a justificatory role.
For example, James McAllister and Theo Kuipers, develop models of aesthetic judgement in scinence that are rational and have links to truth and empirical adequacy.
McAllister
argues that aesthetic judgements are connected to empirical judgements through an inductive mechanism.
As scinetist use, for example, judgments of simplicity in choosing theoriesn and such judgemens accumalate a track records of success, the association between aesthetic judgements and empirical success becomes stronger.
McAllister calls this process aesthetic induction.
Theo Kuipers uses a probabilistic model of the aesthetic induction to investigate the connection between aeshetic judgements and truth approximations.
He, further explicates McAllister's aesthetic induction by grounding it in the mere-exposure effect documented in cognitive science.
In the mere-exposure effects, subjects show a peference, or even taste, for stumuli to wich they have been exposed in the paste.
An such preference increases as the subject is more exposed.
Montano, however, points out that justifications based on aesthetic induction fail to account for the fact that it is not only aesthetically meritorious properties, such as simplicity, that exhibit a track record of empirica success, but also the opposite properties, such as complexity.
Montano further points out that, historically, the merit of simplicity does not seem to depend on a track record of empirical success.
The appreciation of the beauty of simplicity seems only to respond to the subjective preference for aesthetically pleasing merit of simpliicty.

Thus, there are both counter examples to simplcity being associated to empirirical success, conversely to empiritcal success being associated to simplicity.

### OME MORE PROBLEM WITH INDUCTIVE APPROACHES.
McAllister and Kuipers's approaches
propose an inducntive connection as justification of evaluations based on aesthetic preference.
However, such strategy amounts to saying one must re-interpret aesthetic judgement not as genuinely aesthetic, but only as refferring to some kind of secondary connection between the aestheric and a proper rational justification.
This, however does not seem to be the attitude of scientists when they cite beauty of simplicity as a reason to prefer one or other thoery.
They seem to be making genuine aesthetic judgements.
At any rate, even if in some cases there would be hidden non-aesthetic justification, if there exist eve one genuine case in which the judgemt is properly subjective, this is the most difficult and interesting case.
And this would prevent a genereal justification of asthetics cases of simplicity.

## DERKSE: AESTHETIC REVISIONIST APPROACH.
Another strategy to justify simplicity based on the subjective preference is to claim that this kind of simplcity's value is part of science's aims and methods.
This seems to be the stratefy of
[[
ZZZZ zotero
Derkse, W., 1992, On Simplicity and Elegance, Delft: Eburon.
]].
Derkse argues that,
the preference for simplicity is grounded on the beauty of simplicity.
Simplicity, thus, possesses intrinsic value.
He further argues that,
the methods and aims of science themselves, are not ultimately rationally justified.
Thus in endorsing simplicity as an intrinsic value of theories, scinetists act not much differently than in endorsing science's other methods and aims.

One salient problem with this approach is that, as I have mentioned, it is revisionist.
That is, it takes a stance widely different from standard views of what science is.
One inconvenience of 
this view is that it requires to change the conception of scinece in order to fit simplicity in it.
Here is not the place to discuss revisionism of the conception of science, but it is important to point out that even for revisionist views, such as
[[
zzzz zotero
Derkse, W., 1992, On Simplicity and Elegance, Delft: Eburon.
]], 
the standard conception of aestheric considerations poses problems that cannot be addressed satisfactorily.


#### AUTONOMY FIRST APPAERANCE.
I believe that the more foundamental problem with this approaches is to be found not in the conceotuib if scubce but in the cnception of aesthetic considerations, as I have mentioned.

### AUTONOMY.
Perhaps the most problemayic issue with this fact is that genuine aesthetic judgements are condidered to be autonomous from rational and epistemic (or even ethical or practical) considerations, and are considered to be responsive only to their own inner workings.
There are reasons to believe that the disparity between

##################################zzzzzzzz
##################################zzzzzzzz
##################################zzzzzzzz

It is a common view among phisolophers that 
aesthetic considerations, that is the considartions that ground things such aesthettic judgement, aestehtic evaluations aesthetic concepts, and so on, are autonomous from practical, ethical or epistemic ones, and respond only to the inner working of aesthetic preference.
This idea is present in Kant's
[[ZOTERO]]
assertion that the distinctive mark of aesthetic judgements is that they are subjective.
It is also present in contemporary phisophers, such as, Peter Kivy or Frank Sibley.
Kivy, for example,
[[ZOTERO]];
who argues that the independencd of practical and moral considerations is what makes the aesthetic aesthetic.
Sibley, in addressing aesthetic concepts
[[ZOTERO]],
argues that
there is no systematically characterization that connects aestetic descriptions or concepts, such as "beautiful" or "graceful", with everyday predicates, such as curved, connected, countinuuous, and so forth.
This autonomy, I believe, grounds the most problematic aspect of subjectively based prefereces for simplicity.
The truely fundametal problem is not that such judgements prevent the differentiation of genuine and non-geenuine cases of aesthetic judgemens.
Rather, it is the fact that autonomy is part of the deep nature of such judgements.
Therefore, one can never be certain that there are no genuine aesthetic judgements among the multipliccity of cited cases in scince.
Thus, one can never be sure that genuine aestheic judgements can be eliminated from scinece in gereneral.

Moreover, I believe there is an even more conclusive reason why subjectively based reasons fail as a rational justificatio, even if one can find connections between subjectuve judgements and proper rational reasons.
Due to the fact that genuine aesthetic judgements are autonomous from other considerations, the ultimate problem with these subjective justification is that scinctific reasons cannot be aesthetic reason, since these last aree autonomous from scinece.
## DERKSE VS. THE STANDARD AESTHETIC VIEW.
And  the autonomy of the aesthetic posese problems also for revisiosnist approaches such as Derkse's.
For the claim that 
aesthetic considerations may be on equal footing than
other consideration in science may seem plausible in view of the fact that their ultimate justification is problematic.
However, I believe that a closer look not to the standard conception of science, but rather to the standard conception of aesthetic consideration points to a difference in aesthetic considerations that makes them differente from the standards grounds of science's aims and methods.methods.
The standard view of aesthetc considerations states that aesthetic considerations are autonomous from pragmatic, epistemic or ethical considerations.
Now, if this is correct, then aesthetic considerations that justify simplicity cannot be similar to other aims and methods in scince.
Since such aims and methods are intrinsically or pragmaitcally conected to epistemic considerations; whereas aesthetic considerantions are autonomous from them.
Moreover, I believe that this issue is what make simplicioty grounded in subjective aesthetic considerations is irredeemable problematic for science.

## IN SUM.
In sum,
the reason why subjective-based aesthetic preferences cannot be a sientific justification, is simply becuase aestheetic reasons, by their very nature, are autonomous from scinece.
And this is a problem posed by the very nature of aestyheitc consideratioins for all the approaches that seek a rational justification and even revisionist approaches.

And this fact, I believe makes it irredeemable irreconciliable with science.
Thus, I have identified at leasst two examples of cases of simplicity for which we have principled reasons that make the unjustifiable.
The first case, ontological parsimony, is unjustifiable based on logical reasons.
Here perhas the example must be interpreted not as a instance bur rather as a tyupe of strategy that is doomed to fail in principle.
The second case, simplcty justrified base of subjective reasons, such as personal taste, or aesthetic preference, seem to have a even stronger unjustifiable to scinece character, since it its the autonomous nature of subjective preference, makes it irredeemable usuitable, or incompatible with scinece rational reasons.
For this reason, in the following, I will use this kind of simplicity, justified based on the beuaty of simplicity or the aesthetic merit attributed to simple theories, as a paradigm of unjusrifiable simplicity.,


the order oof evaluation is wrong
one ddoes not appreciate simplicity in scincver beeause of beauty,
buy rather,
one appreaicyeds beauty because of scince.
the beauty of simplicity acquitre it value becuase of scince


the simplicity of theory acuire its balue beacuase of beauty
simpliibyt is valuabel becasue of beauty
simplcity's beeauty is valuabnlee becuase of scinece.

the process of how simple theories are attrubuted value, or rather further value,
the traditiona story had it the other way around
had it upside down.
in the traditionaal sstory
theories are attrubuted more value in virue of the beauty of simplciityu.
I contend, by contrast, that
the beauty of simplicity aquire more value in virtue of being science.

## BEFORE AUTONOMY.
on the, one hand, 
the rational and epistemic requirements demanded by a justification in science,
and
, on the other hand,
the subjective factors that seems to ground some of the scientists's preferences for simplicty
is inherent to the nature of aesthetic judgement.
For, according to a very common view among philosophers
an autonomy from rational and epistemic considerations
is part of what characterizes 
aesthetic judgement.

This means that any genuine aetehtic judgement in scinece may be aotunomous fron sciences's epistemic and pragmatic consideratrions.
This, in turn, opens the posssibility that the aesytheti judgemenyt are no only indepemdent byut contradictory to siocnece values, methods and factors.
But perhaps the most problemayic issue is that genuine aesthetic judgements are condidered autonomoud form epistemis, ethical or practical consideration and are responsive only to the inner workings of the aesthetic subjective factors.

# TWO DIFFERENCES: AUTONOMY AND REASON ALREADY
there are two differences between subjective justifications and other worst-case cases.
The first is that unlike the other justification, such an onlofical cases, the astheric-meri-based are already reason.
In the other cases the problem is that one can discover that there is no real reason or jusrification under closer examination.

## OTHER PROBLEM: IT IS REASON ALREADY.
But here, the subjective reason are reasons or justifications in itselves, just not ones acceptable in the context of scientific doman of justification.

## in sum
There are two possiclr roles.
One, there is an inherent epistemic connection, for example, beauty is truth conducivb, or conducive the the pholosophers preferred spistemic aim.
Two, there is a contingent connection.
For instance, there is anductive connection, such as the one suggested by MacAllister or Kuipers.

Now, if the stanrd view, that aesthetic consideration are inherently autonomous, then both alternatives are implusible.
For, if there is a inherent connection, then the connection is autonomous of other considerations, and then there is a subjective part of sinece that is autonopmous from rational considersations.
Or, in the contingen alternative, even if there is a connection, the connection itself cannot warrant a rational outcome.
Since it is a connection to something subjective and autonomous from science.
This, in the end, reduces to somethig subjective and autonomous from non-aesthetic considerations.
