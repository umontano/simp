The main revision I propose is the way simplicity is valued, or acquires value, in the context of assesssing theories.

The typical story, in for example cases of pragmamitcally advantageous simplicity, goes somethin like this:
Simpler thoeries are more valuable than other thoeries.
the value attributed to simplicity in this context comes from its pragmatyic value, in, for example, helping to achieve science aims.

What I wish to do is to propose that
there exists at least another way in which value is attributed to simplicity.
And it runs in the opposite direction to the standard story:
the value associated to simplicity comes from the fact that it occurs in a scinetific thoery.

To illustrate this,
consider the example of how one would evaluate the simplicity of the Goldbach conjecture.
