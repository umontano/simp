the main point I propose to revise is the way simplicity is valued, or acquires value in the context of assesssing theories.
acuires value.
The typical story goes somethin like this:
Simpler thoeries are more valuable than other thoeries.
the value attributed to simplicity in this context comes from its pragmatyic, metaphysical or aesthetic value.
My interpretation runs in the opposite direction:
the value associted to simplicity comes from the fact that it occurs in a scinetific thoery.

To illustrate this,
consider the example of how one would evaluate the simplicity of the Goldbach conjecture.
